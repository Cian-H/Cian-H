# 👋 Hello, other programmers!

Hi, I'm Cian. Data scientist at a science and engineering research centre. This account will be full of random projects that interest me. Things that interest me include:

- Machine learning
- Symbolic AI
- Data visualisation
- Doing stuff with massive datasets
- Trying to convince python to do things it wasn't designed to do (i.e.: 90% of what data scientists do)

If you're also interested in these things you might be interested in my projects, so feel free to explore my repos!
